# Analyzing ESMFold Model's Performance on Antibody Sequences with Diverse Input Methods

![alt text](https://github.com/jiwonckm/ESMFold-Linker-Project/blob/main/protein.png)
Our project analyzes the performance of ESMFold when predicting the structure of multi-chain antibody sequences with different ways of inputting the multi-chains as a single-chain. Data was collected from SAbDab. 

Authors: Ji Won Kim, Adrina Tang, Anna Kwon

## Running predictions

All steps we took to draw the results are written in run.ipynb.
